      Just finished grueling WebDev week 1. Clearly they're looking to outsource onto us maximum advertising and educational tasks. What's frustrating is how useful thos skills are - we need them to show us how to sell out. Teaching yourself isn't selling out, but it's really lame when you're supposed to be hiring someone to help you, and they just point you to the right "link."

        Things to keep in mind: research really f---ing matters. DATA IS REAL. Even though the media hype around it is totally disproportionate to its actual import, what it offers is real improvement. Even though the improvement is totally small, it's rock solid.

        What am I doing?

      If they don't let me into CAPP, it seems pretty hard to justify the Harris gig. Especially if they don't give me a discount. I can still wait to decide up until, I don't know, one or two weeks into the semester? Have to check.

        Right now the tech is primarily a way to prove myself. It's good, I never thought of myself as being this intelligent, this capable. I'm smart as shit. I can handle hard shit, it's okay. Now the question is what on earth do I want to focus on.

        Figuring out how to automate research is not a bad idea at all. Probably the best thing I can do. Jens is on board. Ask him for advice. He's a little better than Rayid about some things, he'll have good advice. Especially about good social science automated research. We could work on predictions together. We'll see - a good econ route.

        I really am wedded to the clinton idea for next summer - next year.So I should do a bunch of Clinton research right now. Read the critics and the fans.
